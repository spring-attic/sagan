## Sagan: the spring.io site and reference application

Welcome! The code in this repository is deployed and running right now at [spring.io](http://spring.io). The [blog][], the collection of [guides][], and most everything else you see there is implemented right here.

In addition to the practical purpose of powering Spring's home on the web, this project is designed to serve as a *reference application*–a resource that developers can use to see how the Spring [team][] have used Spring to implement a real-world app with a few interesting requirements. You can learn more about the background and motivation behind the Sagan project on the wiki's [about page][].

## Getting started

The simplest way to get started is to browse the GitHub repository and find what's of interest to you – you'll find Javadoc througout the code, README files in key directories, and a complete set of how-to documents in the project [wiki][]. The app and its documentation are designed with the idea of a 'self-guided tour' in mind.

Next, get the site up and running for yourself. It takes just a few minutes to [get the code][], [build][] and [run][] the Sagan app on your local machine – and it's easy to [import the source][] into your IDE. From there, you may be interested in other tasks such as [running the site on Cloud Foundry][]. See the wiki for a full list of topics to explore.
