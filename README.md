## Sagan – a Spring reference application

Welcome! The code in this repository is deployed and running right now at <http://spring.io>. The [blog][], the collection of [guides][], and most everything else you'll see there is implemented right here.

In addition to the practical purpose of powering Spring's home on the web, this project is also designed to serve as a *reference application* – a resource that developers can use to see how the Spring [team][] have used Spring to implement a web app with a few interesting requirements. For that reason, you'll find documentation everywhere you go: Javadoc in the code itself, README files in many directories as you explore the codebase, and on the project [wiki][] as well.

### Sagan? As in *Carl Sagan?*

Yeah, [that guy][sagan]. He was a pretty inspiring [explainer of things][cosmos], and we named this project after him with the goal of explaining what modern-day Spring has to offer in the context of building a real-world web app. We hope you enjoy and get value out of it, and that in some small way the project might live up to its namesake.

## Getting started

It takes just a few minutes to [build and run the app on your local box][build-and-run] and it's easy to [import the source][import-source] into your IDE. From there, you can focus on the areas that are most important to you. Be sure to browse the rest of the [wiki][] and take note of the README files throughout the application's directory structure.

## Issue tracking

If you have any feedback or questions along the way, don't hesitate [add an issue][issues].
