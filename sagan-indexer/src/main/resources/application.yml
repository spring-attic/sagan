  # Credentials are based on users belonging to a particular GitHub team,

  # GitHub OAuth application credentials for use when logging into administrative
  # console at /admin. Default 'id' and 'secret' values apply only when running
  # locally, i.e. at http://localhost:8080. Production values must be overridden
  # using GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET, respectively.

  # This optional property may be assigned using a "personal access token" created
  # at https://github.com/settings/applications. It is used for accessing GitHub's
  # API, even for operations that do not require authorization (e.g. Getting Started
  # Guide repositories). This is done in order to work against higher rate limits
  # (5000req/hour vs. the default 60req/hour without a token). When running the app
  # locally, this lower default is fine. When running the app in production, the
  # token is a must. See https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting.
