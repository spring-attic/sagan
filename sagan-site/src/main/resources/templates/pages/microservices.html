                    <p class='big'>Microservice architectures are growing in popularity. Spring can help you write microservices that are small and self-contained and has many tools to help you look after your microservices once they’re in the hands of your users. In addition, Spring Cloud can help your microservices work together so that you can reliably deliver rich functionality to your users.</p>

                    <p class='mb-3'>With Spring Boot, your microservices can start small and iterate fast. That’s why it has become the de facto standard for Java™ microservices. Quickstart your project with Spring Initializr and then package as a JAR. With Spring Boot’s embedded server model, you’re ready to go in minutes.</p>
