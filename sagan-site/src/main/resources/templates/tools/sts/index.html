          <p class="tools--description">The Spring Tool Suite is an Eclipse-based development environment that is customized for developing Spring applications. It provides a ready-to-use environment to implement, debug, run, and deploy your Spring applications, including integrations for Pivotal tc Server, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Git, Maven, AspectJ, and comes on top of the latest Eclipse releases.</p>
          <p class="tools--description">Included with the Spring Tool Suite is the developer edition of Pivotal tc Server, the drop-in replacement for Apache Tomcat that's optimized for Spring. With its Spring Insight console, tc Server Developer Edition provides a graphical real-time view of application performance metrics that lets developers identify and diagnose problems from their desktops.</p>
          <p class="tools--description">The Spring Tool suite supports application targeting to local, virtual and cloud-based servers. It is freely available for development and internal business operations use with no time limits, fully open-source and licensed under the terms of the Eclipse Public License.</p>

            <h3>Understands your Spring App</h3>
            <p class="tools-feature--description">The Spring Tool Suite understands your Spring projects. It parses your configuration files and displays detailed information about the beans that are being defined, their dependencies among each other, used namespaces, and extracts overviews for certain stereotypes like request controllers, aspects, services, and more.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tools-feature--container">
            <div class="tools-feature--thumbnail sts-validations-detail"></div>
            <h3>Comprehensive Validations for your Spring Configuration</h3>
            <p class="tools-feature--description">Because the Spring Tool Suite understands your Spring projects, it provides a comprehensive set of validations that are being applied automatically. Those validations indicate errors in your configurations directly within the IDE, long before you actually run the app. Finding problems and misconfigurations gets a lot easier.</p>

          <div class="tools-feature--container">
            <div class="tools-feature--thumbnail sts-refactoring-support-detail"></div>
            <h3>Refactoring Support for your Spring App</h3>
            <p class="tools-feature--description">Refactoring support is one of the most important parts of todays software engineering. Therefore the Spring Tool Suite provides advanced support for refactoring Spring applications. Not only the well-known Java refactorings are reflected in your Spring config files, the IDE adds new refactorings for Spring elements (like renaming of Spring beans, for example).</p>

          <div class="tools-feature--container">
            <div class="tools-feature--thumbnail sts-content-assist-detail"></div>
            <h3>Code Assists All Over the Place</h3>
            <p class="tools-feature--description">It doesn't matter whether you are writing Spring XML configuration files or implement JavaConfig Spring apps, whether you are using the core Spring framework alone or together with all the various additional Spring projects, the Spring Tool Suite provides you with meaningful content-assist all over the place, together with quick-fixes for common errors and problems. You will never program with Spring without those code-assists anymore.</p>

            <div class="tools-feature--thumbnail sts-graphical-editors-detail"></div>
            <h3>Graphical Viewers and Editors</h3>
            <p class="tools-feature--description">Want to get an overview of the bean dependencies in your Spring app? Or wanna visualize and edit Spring Integration, Spring Batch, or Spring Webflow definitions? Check out the graphical editors that come with the Spring Tool Suite, right in your IDE, just one click away from your configuration files.</p>

            <div class="tools-feature--thumbnail sts-aop-support-detail"></div>
            <h3>The Best AOP Support Available</h3>
            <p class="tools-feature--description">The Spring Tool Suite integrates with the AspectJ language tooling for Eclipse and provides the most comprehensive support for AOP that is available today. Aspects are being recognized, incrementally woven into your system, and visualized directly within the IDE. And see where pointcuts match immediately after saving a file.</p>
