/*
    FIXME: This rule should be moved alongside filterable/filter.js in sagan-client
    This OOCSS state is used to hide/show filterable items (eg gs guides, tutorials,
    docs), and belongs with it's associated JS controller filterable/filter.js.
    Instead of starting to fragment the CSS, however, I decided it's best to put
    it here until we dig into CSS refactoring for real
