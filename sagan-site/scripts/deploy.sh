      and (optional) PATH_TO_CF is the path to the 'cf' executable
      and (optional) EMAIL and PASSWORD are your CF credentials

    *** if the optional arguments are not passed in, it assumes 'cf'
        is on your path and you are logged in correctly

    *** passing in one optional argument requires all others as well
