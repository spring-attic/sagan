# JavaScript Tests

This directory contains JavaScript unit tests and functional scenario tests, both of which are driven by the [Buster.JS](http://busterjs.org) testing framework.  The functional tests also require a [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org) server.

## Unit tests

Tests live in the `unit` directory in a parallel structure to the sources (which are in src/main/resources/static for now).  Run the unit tests from the *root dir* of the project:

`npm test`

## Functional Scenario Tests

*Coming Soon*
