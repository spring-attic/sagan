# {!begin#how-to-complete-this-guide}
How to complete this guide
--------------------------

Like all Spring's [Getting Started guides](/getting-started), you can start from scratch and complete each step, or you can bypass basic setup steps that are already familiar to you. Either way, you end up with working code.

To **start from scratch**, move on to [Set up the project](#scratch).

To **skip the basics**, do the following:

 - [Download][zip] and unzip the source repository for this guide, or clone it using [git](/understanding/git):
`git clone https://github.com/springframework-meta/{@project-name}.git`
 - cd into `{@project-name}/initial`
 - Jump ahead to [Create a resource representation class](#initial).

**When you're finished**, you can check your results against the code in `{@project-name}/complete`.

# {!begin#build-system-intro}
First you set up a basic build script. You can use any build system you like when building apps with Spring, but the code you need to work with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) and [Gradle](http://gradle.org) is included here. If you're not familiar with either, refer to [Getting Started with Maven](../gs-maven/README.md) or [Getting Started with Gradle](../gs-gradle/README.md).
{!end#build-system-intro}


# {!begin#android-build-system-intro}
In this section you set up a basic build script and then create a simple application. 

> **Note:** If you are new to Android projects, before you proceed, refer to [Getting Started with Android](../gs-android/README.md) to help you configure your development environment. 

You can use any build system you like when building apps with Spring, but the code you need to work with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) and [Gradle](http://gradle.org) is included here. If you're not familiar with either, refer to [Getting Started with Maven](../gs-maven-android/README.md) or [Getting Started with Gradle](../gs-gradle-android/README.md).

# {!begin#create-directory-structure-hello}
### Create the directory structure

In a project directory of your choosing, create the following subdirectory structure; for example, with `mkdir -p src/main/java/hello` on *nix systems:

    └── src
        └── main
            └── java
                └── hello
{!end#create-directory-structure-hello}


# {!begin#create-directory-structure-org-hello}
### Create the directory structure

In a project directory of your choosing, create the following subdirectory structure; for example, with the following command on Mac or Linux:

```sh
$ mkdir -p src/main/java/org/hello
```

    └── src
        └── main
            └── java
                └── org
                    └── hello
{!end#create-directory-structure-org-hello}

# {!begin#create-android-manifest}
### Create an Android manifest

The [Android Manifest] contains all the information required to run an Android application, and it cannot build without one.

# {!begin#related-resources}
Related resources
-----------------
You can continue your exploration of Spring and REST with the following Getting Started guides:

* [Handling POST, PUT, and GET Requests in REST Services](TODO)
* [Creating Self-Describing APIs with HATEOAS](TODO)
* [Securing a REST Service with HTTP Basic](TODO)
* [Securing a REST Service with OAuth](TODO)
* [Building a RESTful Web Service](https://github.com/springframework-meta/gs-rest-service-core/blob/master/README.md)
* [Consuming RESTful Web Services with Spring](https://github.com/springframework-meta/gs-consuming-rest-core/blob/master/README.md)
* [Testing REST Services](TODO)

# {!begin#bootstrap-starter-pom-disclaimer}
TODO: mention that we're using Spring Bootstrap's [_starter POMs_](../gs-bootstrap-starter) here.

> Note to experienced Maven users who don't use an external parent project: You can take out the project later, it's just there to reduce the amount of code you have to write to get started.

{!end#bootstrap-starter-pom-disclaimer}


# {!begin#build-and-run-android}
Build and run the client
------------------------

With an attached device or emulator running, invoke the code and see the results of the REST request:

```sh
$ mvn clean package android:deploy android:run
```

The command builds the Android app and runs it in the emulator or attached device.
{!end#build-and-run-android}


# {!begin#build-an-executable-jar}
### Build an executable JAR

Now that your `Application` class is ready, you simply instruct the build system to create a single, executable jar containing everything. This makes it easy to ship, version, and deploy the service as an application throughout the development lifecycle, across different environments, and so forth.

Add the following configuration to your existing Maven POM:

`pom.xml`
```xml
    <properties>
        <start-class>hello.Application</start-class>
    </properties>

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
```

The `start-class` property tells Maven to create a `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file with a `Main-Class: hello.Application` entry. This entry enables you to run the jar with `java -jar`.

The [Maven Shade plugin][maven-shade-plugin] extracts classes from all jars on the classpath and builds a single "über-jar", which makes it more convenient to execute and transport your service.

Now run the following to produce a single executable JAR file containing all necessary dependency classes and resources:

    mvn package

[maven-shade-plugin]: https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin
