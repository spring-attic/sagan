== Sagan: the spring.io site and reference application

==== Latest production deployment image:https://travis-ci.org/spring-io/sagan.svg?branch=master[Build Status,link=https://travis-ci.org/spring-io/sagan]

Welcome! The code in the master branch of this repository is deployed and running right now at http://spring.io[spring.io]. The http://spring.io/blog[blog], the collection of http://spring.io/guides[guides], and everything else you see there is implemented right here.

In addition to the practical purpose of powering Spring's home on the web, this project is designed to serve as a _reference application_â€“a resource that developers can use to see how the http://spring.io/team[Spring team] have used Spring to implement a real-world app with a few interesting requirements. We hope you'll find it useful!

== Getting started

You'll find everything you need to get started in the https://github.com/spring-io/sagan/wiki[project wiki], but you can also begin by simply browsing through the repository and finding what's of interest to you. You'll find README files in key directories, and Javadoc throughout the code. The app and all of its documentation are designed with the idea of a 'self-guided tour' in mind.
